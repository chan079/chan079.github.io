Subject:  [PATCH] fig2pstricks text.c bugfix

Hello!

Not sure you are still maintaining this piece of code...

Nevertheless I have found a bug in a text handling code.
The problem manifests itself if there are text symbols with a code > 127
in a .fig file. The assignment (integer) n = (signed char) *p at lines
43 and 47 in text.c will result in a negative n and lead to the out-of-bound
access at line 141 in text.c
The attached patch is a quick band-aid, it is better to check the whole
code for such errors and you know the code much better than me...

Thanks for the nice converter anyway!

- Change fprintf(fp,string) to fprintf(fp,"%s",string) to avoid
  compile-time warning on OS X.

0.7.1 (2009-02-18)
- Version number is fixed.
- Add "-12" and "-11" options, which insert "12pt" and "11pt"
  respectively to the document option.
- Add 'configure' which does nothing.
- Add 'make install' and 'make uninstall' to install the executables
  in /usr/local/bin.
  'make DESTDIR=/usr install' works. But 'DESTDIR=/usr make install'
  does not.
- fig2epspdf is a bit cleaned up.
- Prebuilt MSDOS binary is not provided anymore.
  You can build yours using MinGW.
  Install MinGW and compile it: 
    PATH_TO_MINGW\bin\gcc -o fig2pstricks.exe *.c
  in the source directory.
  For example, I installed MinGW in my wine system and ran
    wine c:/mingw/bin/gcc -o fig2pstricks.exe *.c
  and fig2pstricks.exe was built.

0.7.0 (2009-02-15)
- A bug regarding wrong vertical alignment of text was fixed 
  ('[B]' option added).
  See revised test/text.fig to test it and the new test/legend.fig
- fig2epspdf script was added
- MSDOS binary compiled by Wine+MinGW

0.6.9 (2007-08-07)
- Add --empty option. This adds \thispagestyle{empty} at the end of
  the output if the "-c" option is used. This additional output is 
  commented out (by %%) when "-c" is not used.
- Change fopen mode from "r" to "rb" for compatibility with MSDOS
  MSDOS binary compiled by MinGW32

0.6.8 (2005-09-14)
Thanks to Tim Gollnik and his xfig file,
some major bugs were found and fixed.
- The depth of a 'compound' object is now better handled (but not
  perfect yet).
- Text are better handled. A new commandline option --latex-symbols
  is introduced.  If fig2pstricks is called with --latex-symbols,
  then texts are translated into latex symbols. Default is that
  the texts are copied verbatim so that any latex commands are
  nicely copied to pstricks. But if unusual characters (such as #, %,
  etc) are included in the xfig file, then the resulting latex file
  obtained without the "--latex-symbols" option would not compile.
- ASCII code 128-255 are (almost) perfectly handled (e.g., umlauts,
  etc). Try with test/crazytexts.fig with and without --latex-symbols.
- I do not yet understand what is going on with the "free" function
  in sort_by_depth() in node.c.

0.6.7 (2005-08-22)
- A minor bug fixed (?)
  Line 3 from the bottom of sort_by_depth function in node.c
  causes a trouble.
  So I simply commented it out, but I don't know what is happening.
  It used to be okay, but suddenly it doesn't work.

0.6.6 (2005-01-29)
- -p option added: "padding" (experimental)
- Bugfix: Segmentation fault when color=-1 (default color)
  Thanks to Matti Ristinmaa who pointed it out.
- Bugfix: Overlay was incorrectly set previously.
- Improvement: Symbol font supported (perhaps imperfect?)
  Thanks to Matti Ristinmaa for the fig file to work with.
- Other small bugs fixed.
- --debug option added. Not really useful, though.
- MS-DOS version compiled by mingw32:
    .../cross-tools/bin/i386-mingw32msvc-gcc -c *.c
    .../cross-tools/bin/i386-mingw32msvc-gcc -o fig2pstricks.exe *.o
  I tested with
    wine ./fig2pstricks.exe test.fig
  and it worked.

0.6.5 (2004-05-03): Not released
- Bug fix: dotscale is set for every "\psdot"

0.6.4 (2004-04-07)
- Do not include <libgen.h> and correspondingly remove 'basename'
  from fig2pstricks.c so that it is compiled in MS-DOS with no warnings.
- Remove unused functions from source.
- MS-DOS version compiled by DJGPP.

0.6.3 (2004-03-22)
- Bug fix: In color.c, correct \newgraycolor{...} to \newgray{...}
- Bug fix: In text.c, "\\001" is now correctly handled
  (hopefully). Only "\001" is regarded as the end of string.
- MS-DOS version compiled using DJGPP

0.6.2 (2004-02-24)
- Bug fix: Special characters (eg. \, &, etc) are correctly 
  converted now.
  Note: Special characters are literally converted. For example, '&'
  is converted to '&', NOT to '\&'.

0.6.1 (2004-02-17)
- Fix a minor bug of failing to inputting color package in prosper mode.

0.6   (2004-01-24)
- Initial release

Known bugs
----------
- linecolor and dotscale properties are not updated correctly.
